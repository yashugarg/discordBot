## Inspiration
Being Discord users ourselves, we have attempted to create the perfect bot for social events. We wanted to incorporate features that we felt were necessary and useful.

## What it does
Selfie-ish can perform a wide range of tasks that include some responsive test functions 👀, an 8-Ball trivia game 🎱, performing admin rights functions 🚔, a fully functioning music player 🎵 that uses YouTube as its search platform, a token-rank feature 📈 based on user activity, an interactive AI chatbot 💬 feature, Wikipedia search 🔍 and some developer functions 👥 for better performance.

## How we built it
For the creation of Selfie-ish, we have used Python as the primary programming language and git as the core version control tool. This project was built on the VS Code IDE. Through the integration of various APIs and packages such as discord.py, youtube_dl, wikipedia, aiml, etc., we have included each new feature step by step.

## Challenges we ran into
The first and foremost challenge was to decide what all features would be necessary for Selfie-ish. While implementing the Token-Rank feature, we faced a lot of difficulty in the integration of Cockroach DB since it was our first time working with it. Also, it took quite a bit of time in testing and debugging of the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite all the challenges we faced, our team was successful in implementing a fully operational version of Selfie-ish. We were able to include all the features that we planned to incorporate and create a unique and multi-featured bot for hosting social events and gatherings on Discord.

## What we learned
By working on this project, we enhanced our knowledge of Python and its various APIs, git, Cockroach DB, etc. We combined our skills and contributed individually to the team, efficiently managing time and completing the project. We learned how to integrate multiple files into a single project. Through this integration, we could include a wide range of features into the application and segregate them with ease.

## What's next for Selfie-ish Discord Bot
We will further work on the bot and include even more features. For future prospects, we aim to develop a blog website for Selfie-ish wherein we will mention all its commands and functionalities, along with its Discord invite link. Later on, we will deploy our bot on a 24-hour active server for users to enjoy it anytime they desire.
